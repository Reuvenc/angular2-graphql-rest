# Angular2 with REST Api and GraphQL

## Apollo Client with angular2-apollo

#### How to start

We have to create tables

```bash
npm run migrate
```

Then load some data

```bash
npm run seed
```

Now, we're ready to start an app

```bash
npm start
```

**OR just**

```bash
npm run start:clean
```
